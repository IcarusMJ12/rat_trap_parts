Rat Trap Parts
==============

The name of the game is illustrative of the gameplay itself.
Generate new words from a word by making an anagram of it and adding any one
letter of your choice.  You may also split a word into several as part of the
same process as long as each new word is at least 3 characters long.
Words can never be repeated, even in different forms.
